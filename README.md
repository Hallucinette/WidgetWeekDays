# WidgetWeekDays
First widget I do


### Objective :

the project involves creating a widget that evolves over time.
In Version 1, the widget changes its background color daily, using 7 colors, starting on Sunday.
Version 2 adds daily quotes with authors, using the same 7 colors. The MVVM architecture is recommended. Finally,
Version 3 allows viewing the list of quotes in the application, with a single parsing for both displays. Each version of the project should be broken down into smaller steps to ensure secure progress.
